## Setup Instructions

To create your React app and install OpenLayers, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new React app:**
   ```
   npx create-react-app openlayers-react-map
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```
   cd openlayers-react-map
   ```

3. **Install OpenLayers:**
   ```
   npm install ol
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can view the OpenLayers map by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The map will be rendered in the main application component. You can customize the map view, layers, and interactions in the `src/App.jsx` file.
